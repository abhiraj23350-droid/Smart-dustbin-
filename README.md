# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin System (Automatic Touchless Trash Can)
# 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Dustbin System is an automatic touchless trash can that opens and closes its lid using an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor.

The main goal of this project is to improve hygiene and reduce the spread of germs by eliminating the need to touch the dustbin.

# This project is useful for:

🏠 Homes

🏥 Hospitals

🏫 Schools

🏢 Public places

# ⚙️ Components Used

🔹 Arduino Uno

🔹 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

🔹 Servo Motor (SG90)

🔹 Jumper Wires

🔹 Breadboard

🔹 External Power Supply (Optional)

# 🛠️ Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.

When an object (like a hand) is detected within 10–15 cm:

Arduino sends a signal to the servo motor.

The servo motor rotates and opens the lid automatically.

After 3–5 seconds, the lid closes automatically.

This process ensures completely touch-free operation.
